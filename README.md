* This project is my developer portfolio website.
* I'll keep updating it with time (also will grasp React in the process)

## Project Setup

Make sure that you have tools like `npm`, `npx` and `node` setup and working on your local. 

You can run the following make scripts for specific purposes:

### `make`
This downloads all the dependencies of the project mentioned in the `package.json` file and consequently builds the project.

### `make clean`
This removes (cleans) all the local dependencies of the project.

### `make fmt`
This formats your JS code according to [standardjs](https://standardjs.com/)

### `make local`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any ESLint errors in the console.

### `make github`
Builds and deploys the application to github pages.
